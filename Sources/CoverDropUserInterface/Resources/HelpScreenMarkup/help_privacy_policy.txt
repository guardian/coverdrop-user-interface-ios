# Secure Messaging privacy policy

The Secure Messaging software in the Guardian app is currently in a testing phase. At this stage the feature does not have a distinct privacy policy to that which we publish for the rest of the Guardian app.

### All Secure Messaging users are anonymous

This feature is designed to be used anonymously. As a consequence, messages sent to our journalists using Secure Messaging contain no accompanying data about who sent that message, from where, and from what kind of device. We can't even tell exactly when you wrote a message.

If you are signed in to the Guardian app, that information is not known by the Secure Messaging feature. Similarly, the rest of the Guardian app on your mobile device does not know if you are sending messages to the Guardian using Secure Messaging. So this tool does not allow us to discover anything about you that you don't choose to tell us.

We will update this page with more details as we move towards launching this feature more widely.
