# Frequently asked questions

## General

### Who is Secure Messaging for?

We built the Guardian Secure Messaging service to allow readers to contact our journalists directly about news stories that we are covering or should be covering. If you know about something that should be reported, tell us using Secure Messaging and we will handle your tip confidentially and responsibly.

Unlike other apps that require technical skills to ensure security, Secure Messaging is designed for anyone to use with ease. All you need is to remember your passphrase – no technical expertise required. Whether you're a PA, nurse, data scientist, police officer, supermarket worker, public servant, intern, or CEO, this app is for you. It’s made for people who are witnessing injustice and need the Guardian’s help to bring it to light.

### Who is it not for?

The Secure Messaging service is purely for story tips. Don’t use it for customer service enquiries, letters to the editor, article submissions, complaints, etc. Such messages will be ignored. Please see theguardian.com/contact-us for advice on how to get in touch about those things.

### Is it really anonymous? I’m signed in to the Guardian app.

It is anonymous even if you are signed in. The Secure Messaging app only knows the content of your message. It will not know anything else about you. Not your email, name or history of articles.

Users of the Guardian app can use the Secure Messaging service whether or not they are signed in to the app. And when they do so, the Secure Messaging component of the app has no access to information about the user. Similarly, when someone sends a Secure Message to our journalists, no information about the user, their device, or their location is contained within the data that gets sent to our Secure Messaging servers. Not even the Guardian can tell which app sent us a real message. We know nothing about Secure Messaging sources other than what they tell us.

## Interaction with journalists

### I don't know who to speak to. Who should I contact?

If you don’t know which journalist might specialise in the matter you wish to raise, you could browse our existing journalism on related subjects and see what names appear next to those articles. If you’re still not sure, pick a team such as “Environment team” or “Investigations team”. Those messages will go to the duty editor for that team. If they want to follow up they may do so themselves or they may direct you to a specific reporter.

### What does 'Pending' mean? Why aren't my messages sent immediately?

The pending message you see is part of a sophisticated system to keep your actions hidden. Your real message is delayed because it will be sent when your phone would normally send a decoy “cover” message. This means the time you use the app cannot be linked to when a message is sent. This disguise technique is one of the many ways we keep you and your messages secret.

To make the sending of real messages from a person indistinguishable from the “cover” messages that the Guardian apps automatically generate, we have to send both types at similar times. If we didn’t do that it would in theory be possible to determine patterns in the app’s activity that correspond to the sending of real messages. Potentially that could help identify a source.

We can’t send messages constantly, because we need to keep the overall Secure Messaging network traffic tiny in order for it not to impact customers’ network load. So instead we usually send messages (both real and “cover”) when people close or “background” their apps. There can be other delays – e.g. messages can get queued up when the system is busy. This too is to avoid potentially suspicious peaks and troughs.

DIVIDER

### Who gets to see my messages?

Secure Messages cannot be read by anyone except the Guardian journalists that we have designated to receive source messages. If you select a specific journalist as a recipient, your message is routed directly to them. If you select a team, your message will go to the editor or editors in charge of that team.

Under rare circumstances a substitute journalist will act on behalf of the designated recipient – for example if a reporter is currently unavailable to respond to an ongoing conversation they may entrust a colleague to do so for them. And if someone tries to abuse the system we may sometimes have to moderate messages sent to our colleagues. The people performing such moderation would be Guardian journalists who are already entrusted with dealing with highly confidential material.

DIVIDER

### How long does it take to get a reply?

We can’t promise we’ll reply to anyone. Even when we do, it can take a while. For security reasons, your messages are not sent immediately and aren’t received immediately by us after being sent. Similarly, replies from journalists are neither sent nor received immediately. So even if a reporter replies the moment they receive a message, you may not see that reply for hours. And of course each reporter doesn’t work 24 hours a day or every day, so it could take days.

### Why can't I talk to more than one person at a time?

For the principle of “cover” to work without creating a burden on people’s data use, messages must be quite infrequent. So we only allow one conversation at a time. This restriction also helps us avoid spam or other abuses.

DIVIDER

### How do I choose to speak with a different journalist or team?

There are two ways to do this. You can delete your old conversation to pick someone new to correspond with. This retains your current passphrase. Or you can choose to 'Get started' from the first Secure Messaging page, and set up a new message vault with a new passphrase.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I report a technical problem?

You can report problems with Secure Messaging by going back into the main app, selecting Settings and then Help. However, please note that unlike your communication using Secure Messaging, bug reports are not anonymous: they’re sent from your own email address and can include details about the phone you’re using and your Guardian subscription (if you have one). Your bug report shouldn't discuss the content of your Secure Message. 

Bear in mind that, because bug reports are sent by email, if someone managed to break in to your emails, they could see that you’ve been trying to use Secure Messaging.

### I need to send a document. What should I do?

Contact us via Secure Messaging first, and say you have documents to share. A reporter will discuss with you how best to do that safely.

DIVIDER

### I forgot my passphrase. What should I do?

We don’t have any way to let you reset the passphrase for your current message vault, or to get a passphrase reminder. These would weaken the system’s security. You’ll have to create a new secure message vault and start a brand new conversation.
