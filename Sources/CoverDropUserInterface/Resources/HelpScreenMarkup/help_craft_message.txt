# Craft your first message

We receive hundreds of tips a day. The messages that stand out are clear, detailed and fact-focused.
Paul Lewis

Messages are most credible when they are packed with facts, refer to evidence for those facts, and provide some context for how you know this stuff.

## Include what’s safe

### Facts

Specifics are essential – such as company names, locations and dates:

EXAMPLE
I work at ~‘Company Name’ in Manchester~.

### How you know this

Explain how you have access to this information:

EXAMPLE
I work there as a ~warehouse manager~ so I have access to certain documents.

### Evidence

Describe how your tip can be proved:

EXAMPLE
I have evidence that they’re forcing workers to skip breaks. Managers have sent orders ~in emails on my work computer, plus I have photos~. I think they should be exposed so everyone can see.

Our journalists appreciate that sharing information can be intimidating. You should only share what is best for your safety. However, vague messages are rarely actionable.

## Try to avoid…

### Being vague

Journalists need facts. If you don't explain the who, what, how and when, a reporter is unlikely to spend time trying to work out what you're talking about. Something like the following is unlikely to get a response:

EXAMPLE
I have ~some information~, would you like to know more? ~Someone I know~ is doing ~something illegal~.

### Anonymity

The Secure Messaging system doesn't let us know who you are. If you don't want to be identified as a result of our reporting, we will do everything we can to prevent that from happening. But the credibility of a story tip relies on the credibility of its source. If you can share why you know what you know, it's far more likely to be taken seriously.

EXAMPLE
I know about a criminal abuse of power but ~I can't tell you how I know it~.

### Time pressure

Reply times can vary. It can take up to two weeks. If it can’t wait, consider faster but less secure methods such as email or telephone.

EXAMPLE
Make sure you reply to me on here by the ~end of today~.
